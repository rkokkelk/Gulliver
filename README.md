# Gulliver #

A high performance seeder application developed for *vlaai*. 

## Usage ##

This application is a modified version of the [Deluge](http://www.deluge-torrent.org/) application with some new features used to perform automatic seeding of open-source projects.

* Automatic scanning for torrent & data files
* Automatic seeding of torrent files
* Regular check if new files have been added

In general the Gulliver application requires access to a data folder containing both torrent & data files and will automaticaly find, link and seed the appropiate files. It has been specifically designed for
public mirrors for open-source software which contain torrent files. 

## Status ##

**The current version is not suitable for production. It currently contains bugs which results in major system load, further debugging is therefore required.**
